## About the game
Plungewing McAquaDuck tries to escape the angry trucker, who's taking a bath. Shake the bottle to shoot Plungewing McAquaDuck through the air. Glide and flap to bounce on bubbles to get as far away as possible, but avoid the bubbles filled with farts which will slow him down. The further he gets, the more money/soap he will collect, which he can use to upgrade better bottles, swimming ring and other tools to get even further in future tries.
